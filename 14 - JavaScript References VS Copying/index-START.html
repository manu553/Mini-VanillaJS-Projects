    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200 100

    let name = 'hi';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // hi hi
    name = 'hello';
    console.log(name, name2); // hello hi



    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team); // gives the same output    

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "lux";

    // last element of team AND PLAYERS is now 'lux' instead of 'poppy'. The array team is a reference to the array players
    console.log(players, team);

    // To fix this we need to create a copy of the actual players array, different methods shown below

    //using slice to make a full copy of the players array
    const team2 = players.slice();

    //concat to make a copy
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // or Array.from
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        name: 'Bob Bill',
        age: 44
    };

    // the below doesn't work as you'd expect, again its making a reference so number is also being added to the person object
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 55;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    //use Object.assign()
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, age: 25});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread (doesn't work yet)
    //const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 55,
        social: {
            twitter: '@heelloo',
            facebook: 'hi.bye'
        }
    }

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    //make a copy of wes
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    // the inner object will change for both 'wes' and 'dev', the copy only works for the outer most object, inner objects still act like reference
    dev.social.twitter = 'broken';

    //slightly hackjob way of making a copy of a multi level object, this works because JSON.stringify() will convert the object to a string
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
